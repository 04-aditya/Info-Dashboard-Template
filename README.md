# A Basic Information Dashboard Template

This project is an attempt to make a basic template of a dashboard design to showcase various informations through tabs. This template includes Material UI components, and the navigation is done through react-router-dom.

## Pre-requisites

Ensure you have a stable version of **nodejs** and **npm** installed in your system.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Installs all the dependencies and required libraries in your local repository to ensure the app functions as expected.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
